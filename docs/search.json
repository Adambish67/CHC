Thank you for your patience and understanding. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmpowering healthier lives in East County San Diego—where culture meets clinical knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Cultural Health Connect, our mission is to deliver the most up-to-date, evidence-based guidance on managing chronic disease through diet and lifestyle—tailored specifically to the Middle Eastern and Mexican communities of El Cajon. We believe in the power of moderation rather than elimination, working alongside our community to find practical, sustainable health solutions that honor and respect cherished cultural traditions—especially those centered on food.\n\n\nLearn More Contact Us Donate\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging Chronic Diseases with Cultural Sensitivity\n\n\nChronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease disproportionately affect immigrant communities, including Middle Eastern and Latin American populations in El Cajon. According to a 2020 study published in Diabetes Care, Hispanic and Middle Eastern populations face higher rates of diabetes complications due to barriers like language, cultural misunderstandings, and limited access to tailored healthcare. At Cultural Health Connect, we address these challenges by providing resources that resonate with cultural values while promoting evidence-based practices.\n\n\nOur programs focus on practical strategies, such as incorporating traditional foods into balanced diets and encouraging physical activity that aligns with community lifestyles. For example, we adapt recipes like hummus or mole to be lower in sodium or sugar without sacrificing flavor, ensuring that health recommendations feel familiar and achievable.\n\n\n\n\n\nCulturally Tailored Dietary Practices\n\n\nFood is a cornerstone of Middle Eastern and Mexican cultures, often symbolizing family, community, and heritage. Eliminating beloved dishes like biryani or tamales can feel like a loss of identity. Instead, we promote moderation and smart substitutions. A 2019 study in Ethnicity & Disease found that culturally tailored dietary interventions improve adherence and glycemic control in Hispanic and Middle Eastern patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\n\n\nBalanced Portions\n\n\nUse smaller plates to manage portion sizes, a practice shown to reduce caloric intake by up to 20% (Public Health Nutrition, 2016). For example, enjoy a small serving of pozole with extra vegetables to maintain flavor while controlling calories.\n\n\n\n\nSmart Substitutions\n\n\nSwap high-sodium ingredients in dishes like tabbouleh or enchiladas for herbs and spices. Research from the American Heart Association shows that reducing sodium can lower blood pressure by 5-6 mmHg in hypertensive patients.\n\n\n\n\nIncrease Fiber Intake\n\n\nIncorporate fiber-rich foods like lentils (common in Middle Eastern cuisine) or beans (staples in Mexican dishes). A 2021 study in The Lancet found that high-fiber diets reduce HbA1c levels by 0.5% in diabetic patients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhysical Activity for Health\n\n\nPhysical activity is critical for managing chronic conditions, yet cultural and environmental barriers can make it challenging. A 2023 study in Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health found that community-based exercise programs increase participation among immigrant populations by addressing cultural preferences and accessibility.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Walks\n\n\nJoin or organize group walks in local parks, which foster social connections and physical health. Walking for 30 minutes daily can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events by 19%, according to the American Heart Association.\n\n\n\n\nCultural Dance\n\n\nEngage in traditional dances like dabke or salsa, which are fun and effective for cardiovascular health. A 2018 study in Frontiers in Physiology showed that dance-based exercise improves fitness and mental health in diverse populations.\n\n\n\n\nHome-Based Exercises\n\n\nFor those with limited access to gyms, simple bodyweight exercises like squats or stretching can be done at home. Research from British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020) indicates that home-based workouts are effective for managing blood sugar levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMental Health and Stress Management\n\n\nChronic stress exacerbates conditions like diabetes and hypertension, particularly in immigrant communities facing acculturation challenges. A 2022 study in Journal of Immigrant and Minority Health found that culturally tailored mindfulness programs reduce stress and improve health outcomes in Middle Eastern and Hispanic populations.\n\n\n\n\nMindfulness Practices\n\n\nPractice deep breathing or meditation for 10 minutes daily, inspired by cultural practices like prayer or reflection. Studies show mindfulness reduces cortisol levels by 25% (American Psychological Association, 2014).\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Support\n\n\nParticipate in community gatherings or support groups to share experiences and reduce isolation. Social support improves mental health outcomes, according to a 2019 study in Social Science & Medicine.\n\n\n\n\nCultural Storytelling\n\n\nEngage in storytelling or journaling, drawing from Middle Eastern or Mexican oral traditions, to process emotions. Expressive writing has been shown to lower stress and improve glycemic control (Psychosomatic Medicine, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin Our Community\n\n\nCultural Health Connect is more than a resource—it’s a movement to empower our Middle Eastern and Mexican communities in El Cajon to live healthier, fuller lives.

    "text": "Cultural Health Connect was founded with the aim of bridging cultural gaps in healthcare. We are dedicated to providing culturally relevant health and lifestyle education to immigrant communities in East County San Diego. Our mission is to empower community members by integrating traditional cultural values with modern healthcare practices.\n\n\nOur Founders & Their Mission\n\n\n\n\nCultural Health Connect was founded by Adam Bisharat, Alex Ottersbach, and Isaac Cesena, three friends driven by a shared commitment to improving community health through culturally grounded education. The idea first took shape when Adam was volunteering at a diabetes clinic in El Cajon, where he saw how much of a difference respectful, patient-centered care could make. The clinic met people where they were, honored their cultural diets, and preached moderation over elimination. That approach inspired Adam to think beyond the walls of the clinic. He realized the same kind of care that changed lives in one building could reach far more people if it extended into the local community. Together with Alex and Isaac, he launched Cultural Health Connect to make that vision real. The nonprofit focuses on Middle Eastern and Mexican communities in El Cajon, where chronic illnesses like diabetes and hypertension are common but often poorly addressed by mainstream health messaging. Through community polling, small business partnerships, and guidance from local physicians, the team works to offer health guidance that feels familiar, accessible, and respectful. While we believe the most impactful relationships are formed through face to face interactions, the advice we give can benefit anyone and we hope this webpage can work to broaden our reach in both El Cajon and beyond."
